            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE DECLARATION Of the LORDS and COMMONS</hi> aſſembled in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to the Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E the Lords and Commons aſſembled in the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> conſidering with what wiſedome and publick affection our Brethren of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> did concurre with the endeavours of this Parliament, and the deſires of the whole Kingdome, in procuring and eſtabliſhing a firme peace and amity between the two Nations; and how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly they have ſince invited us to a nearer and higher degree of union, in matters concerning Religion &amp; Church government, which we have moſt willingly and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately embrac'd, and intend to purſue; Cannot doubt but they will with as much forwardnes and affection concurre with us in ſetling peace in this Kingdome, and preſerving it in their own; that ſo we may mutually reap the benefit of that amity and alliance, ſo happily made and ſtrongly confirmed betwixt the two Nations. Wherefore as we did about a year ſince, in the firſt appearance of trouble then beginning amongſt them, actually declare; That in our ſenſe and apprehenſion of the Nationall alliance betwixt us, we were thereby bound to apply the authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and power of this kingdome to the preſervation and maintenance of their peace. And ſeeing now that the troubles of this Kingdome are grown to a greater height, and the ſubtile practice of the Common Enemy of the Religion and Liberty of both Nations, do appeare with
<pb facs="tcp:31432:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->more Evidence, ſtrength and danger then they did at that time, we hold it neceſſary to declare, that in our judgment the ſame obligation lyes upon our Brethren by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Act, with the power &amp; force of that Kingdome to aſſiſt us in repreſſing thoſe amongſt us, who are now in armes, and make Warre not only without conſent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but even againſt the Parliament, and for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we have thought good to make known to our Brethren, that His Majeſtie hath given Commiſſions to divers eminent and known Papiſts, to raiſe forces, and to compoſe an Army in the North, and other parts of this Kingdome, which is to joyne with diverſe forraine forces intended to be tranſported from beyond the Seas, for the deſtruction of this Parliament, and of the Religion and Liberty of the Kingdome: And that the Prelaticall part of the Clergy and their Adherents have likewiſe incited His Majeſty to raiſe another Army, which in His own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he doth conduct againſt the Parliament, and the City of <hi>London,</hi> plundring and robbing ſundry well-affected Townes within their power. And that in proſecution of their malice, they are ſo preſumptuous and predominant of His Majeſties reſolutions, that they forbeare not thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages in places, to which His Majeſty hath given His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all word and protection. A great cauſe and incentive of which malice, proceeds from the deſigne they have to hinder the Reformation of Eccleſiaſticall government in this Kingdom, ſo much longed for by all the true lovers of the Proteſtant Religion. And hereupon we further deſire our Brethren of the Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to raiſe ſuch forces as they ſhall judge ſufficient for the ſecuring the peace of their own borders, againſt the ill-affected perſons there, as likewiſe to aſſiſt us in ſuppreſſing the Army of Papiſts and Forrainers, which, as we expect, will ſhortly be on foot here, and if they be not timely prevented, may prove as miſchievous and deſtructive to that Kingdome, as to our ſelves.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:31432:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 63 -->
And though we ſeek nothing from His Majeſtie that may diminiſh either His juſt Authority or Honour, and have by many humble Petitions endeavoured to put an end to this dangerous and unnaturall Warre &amp; combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Kingdome; and to procure His Majeſties prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſecurity for our Religion, Liberty and perſons, (according to that great truſt which His Majeſty is bound to by the Lawes of the Land;) and ſhall ſtill continue to renew our Petitions in that kind. Yet to our great grief we ſee the Papiſticall, and malignant Counſell ſo prevalent with His Majeſtie, and His perſon ſo engaged to their power, that we have little hope of any better ſucceſſe of our Petitions then We formerly had, and are thereby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſtand upon our juſt defence; and to ſeek the ſpeedy and powerful aſſiſtance of our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the Act agreed upon in the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, the Common duty of Chriſtianity, and the particular intereſt of their own Kingdome.</p>
            <p>To which we hope God will give ſuch a bleſſing, that it may produce the preſervation of Religion, the Honour, Safety and peace of His Majeſtie and all His Subjects; and a more ſtrict conjunction of the Counſells, deſignes and endeavours of both Nations, for the comfort and relief of the reformed Churches beyond Sea.</p>

            <p>We have lately ſeen a paper preſented to Us by the Earl of <hi>Lyndſey,</hi> as a Declaration of the Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament of <hi>England</hi> of the 7. of <hi>Novem.</hi> to Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which after many high taxes of Us and Our Government, very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invites, and in a manner challenges aſſiſtance, from that Our Native Kingdome, of Men and Armes for making Warre againſt Us, making a clayme to that aſſiſtance, by vertue of the late Act of pacification, to the which (out of Our deſire to make a perpetuall union between Our two Kingdomes, for the happineſſe of both, and by it the more firmely to eſtabliſh Our own greatneſſe and juſt power,) We cheerfully conſented.</p>
            <p>As We are at Our ſoule afflicted, that it hath been in the power of any factious, ambitious, and malitious perſons, ſo far to poſſeſſe the hearts of many of Our Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> as to raiſe this miſerable diſtemper and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Kingdome, againſt all Our reall actions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to the contrary, ſo We are glad, that this rage and fury hath ſo far tranſported them, that they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſo groſſe a manner to Our Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe experience of Our Religion, Juſtice, and love of Our People will not ſuffer them to beleeve thoſe horrid ſcandals laid upon Us; and their affection, loyaltie, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of Our Honour, will diſdain to be made inſtruments to oppreſſe their native Soveraigne, by aſsiſting an odious Rebellion. We have from time to time acquainted Our Subjects of that Kingdome with the accidents &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which have diſquieted this: how (after all the acts
<pb facs="tcp:31432:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 64 -->of juſtice, grace, and favour performed on Our part, which were or could be deſired to make a people completely happy) We were driven by the force and violence of rude, and tumultuous aſſemblies, from Our City of <hi>London,</hi> and Our two Houſes of Parliament; How attempts have been made to impoſe laws upon Our ſubjects without Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, contrary to the foundation and conſtitution of this Kingdom; How Our Forts, Goods and Navie were ſeized &amp; taken from Us by force, and imployed againſt Us; Our Revenue and ordinary ſubſiſtence wreſted from Us; How We have been purſued with ſcandalous and reproachfull language; bold, falſe, and ſeditious Paſquils and Libels, publiquely allowed againſt Us, and been told that Wee might, without want of modeſty &amp; duty, be depoſed; How after all this (before any Force raiſed by Us) an Army was raiſed, and a Generall appointed to lead that Army againſt Us, with a Commiſſion to kill, ſlay, and deſtroy all ſuch who ſhould be faithfull to Us; That when We had bin by theſe meanes compelled with the aſſiſtance of Our good Subjects, to raiſe an Army for Our neceſſary defence, We ſent divers gracious Meſſages, earneſtly deſiring that the calamities of a civill war might be prevented by a Treaty, and ſo We might know the grounds of this miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; How We were abſolutely refuſed to be treated with: and how at laſt the Army (raiſed, as was pretended, for the defence of Our Perſon) was brought into the field againſt Us, gave Us battell, and (though it pleaſed God to give Us the victory) deſtroyed many of Our good ſubjects, with as imminent danger to Our own Perſon &amp; Our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as the skil and malice of deſperate Rebels could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive: of all which, &amp; the other indignities which have bin offered Us, We doubt not the duty and affection of Our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Subjects will have ſo juſt a reſentment, that they will expreſſe to the world the ſenſe they have of Our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.

<pb facs="tcp:31432:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 65 -->brought upon Us by Our two Houſes of Parliament: (though in truth no unwarrantable action againſt the law can be juſtified even by that authority.

Members of the Houſe of Commons, there are not now above 80. and of above 100. of the houſe of Peers, not above 15. or 16.

Concerning any Commiſſions granted by Us to Papiſts to raiſe Forces, We muſt referre Our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to a Declaration lately ſet forth by Us upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of that ſcandal, which We ſend together with this: and for Our own true and zealous affection to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, (the advancement whereof Our ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires) We can give no other inſtances, then Our conſtant practice, on which malice it ſelf can lay no blemiſh, and thoſe many proteſtations We have made in the ſight of Almighty God, to whom We know We ſhall be dearly accomptable, if We fail in the obſervation. For that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous imputation of our intention of bringing in forrain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the ſame is raiſed without the leaſt colour or ſhadow of reaſon, and ſolemnly diſavowed by Us in many of Our Declarations; ſo there cannot be a clearer argument to Our ſubjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> that We have no ſuch thought, then that We have hitherto forborn to require the aſſiſtance of that Our native Kingdom, from whoſe obedience, duty &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction We ſhould confidently expect it, if We thought Our own ſtrength here too weak to preſerve Us, and of whoſe courage and loyalty We ſhall look to make uſe, before We ſhall think of any forrain ayd to ſuccour Us. And We know no reaſonable or underſtanding man can ſuppoſe Our good ſubjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> are obliged, or enabled by the late Act of Parliament in both Kingdomes, to obey the invitation which is made to them by this pretended
<pb facs="tcp:31432:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 65 -->Declaration; when it is ſo evidently provided for by that Act, That as the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> ſhall not make war againſt the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without conſent of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> ſo the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall not make war againſt the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> without the conſent of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and when they have alwayes declared themſelves ſo carefull of Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſafety, and juſt Rights, which now undergo ſo great violation.</p>
            <p>This We have thought fit to ſay upon occaſion of this late Declaration, and do commend it to you the Lords of Our privie Councel of Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be communicated and publiſhed to all Our loving Subjects there; and if the grave Counſell and Advice, which you derived hither by your Act of the 22. of <hi>April</hi> laſt, had been followed here, in a tender Care of Our Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of Our Princely Greatneſſe and Authority, then would not this face of Confuſion have appeared, which now threatens this Kingdome: And therefore We require you to uſe your utmoſt Endeavours to informe Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that our Kingdom, of the truth of Our Condition, and that you ſuffer not the ſcandalls and imputations laid on Us, by the malice and Treaſon of ſome men, to make any Impreſſion in the mindes of Our people, to the leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or corrupting their Affection and Loyalty to Us, but that you aſſure them the hardneſſe We now undergoe, and the Armes We have been compelled to take up, are for the defence of Our perſon, and ſafety of Our life, for the maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, for the preſervation of the Laws, Liberties, and Conſtitution of this Kingdome, and for the juſt priviledges of Parliament: and look no longer for the bleſſing of Heaven, then We endeavour the defence and advancement of all theſe: and We doubt not a dutifull concurrence in Our Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the care of Our Honour and juſt Rights will draw down a bleſſing upon that Nation too.</p>

            <p>Having been informed that (according to Our commands expreſſed to you by Our Secretarie the Earle of <hi>Lanerick</hi>) you have given order for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Our Letter to you of the filth of <hi>December,</hi> which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally We wrote in anſwer to a Declaration ſent you by Our Houſes of Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be ſilent, and ſuffer Our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Subjects to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any Information ſo deſtructive, and contrary to Our pious Intentions, as if We either intended to invite a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer to, or encourage Poperie in any of Our Kingdomes; both of which have been ſo far from Our thoughts, that neceſſitie it ſelf could never force Us to either. For though the eminent abilities, and moderate diſpoſition of ſome few of that Profeſſion, hath moved Us in this great extremitie to make uſe of their fidelities, yet We have ever been ſo far from countenancing their Religion, that it hath and ever ſhall be Our ſpeciall care to ſuppreſſe it, by putting in execution thoſe good and wholeſome Lawes already in force againſt them. And as for any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Forraine Forces, it is a fear ſo abſolutely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that We are confident, it is offered for no other end, then (by ſuch ſubtile inſinuations) to infuſe an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the breaſts of Our Scottiſh Subjects, of a danger can be no otherwiſe expreſſed, then under ſuch a generall notion, not being able really to make it appear, either in
<pb facs="tcp:31432:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 66 -->intention or fact. But We are ſo clear from either of theſe, that We conceive nothing can be more for Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, then that the malice of theſe calumnies may be made known to all Our good Subjects; the authours whereof (We are confident) God will never ſuffer to eſcape the hand of Juſtice. And We hope none will beleeve that hereby We mean Our Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whom in none of Our Declarations We have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver accuſed) but onely ſuch factious and ſeditious mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of either Houſes, as We have named, and are ready to proceed againſt legally. Therefore We have thought fit to require you to give order for printing the foreſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to you of the ſeventh of <hi>November</hi> laſt, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to take the beſt courſe of cauſing publiſh it, With Our Letters to you in anſwer thereof, through all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Pariſhes of Our Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereby Our Subjects there will perceive the ſubtile wayes which are uſed to corrupt their fidelities, and allegeance; which otherwiſe being at ſo great a diſtance they cannot poſſibly be informed of. So expecting your obedience herein, We bid you very heartily farewell.</p>
